== Changelog ==

= 3.2.11 =
Enhancements:
- Updates our degree search endpoints for taxonomies to filter results using the post_types argument for get_terms(), where possible, to help ensure results only include terms assigned to at least one degree post. The post_types argument is provided by the Query Terms by Post Types plugin, and will be ignored/have no effect if that plugin is not activated.

= 3.2.10 =
Enhancements:
- Updated imported college and department terms to use `name` field from search service instead of `full_name`, in anticipation of search service v2.5.0 updates.

= 3.2.9 =
Bug Fixes:
- Updates the degree importer logic to ignore degrees that have the "Ignore on Import" flag checked.

= 3.2.8 =
Bug Fixes:
- Fixed splitting columns in twocol layout for Safari and Firefox.

= 3.2.7 =
Enhancements:
- Updated the twocol_grouped layout.

= 3.2.6 =
Enhancements:
- Updated dependencies, added configs and GitHub templates.
- Added a two-column layout ('twocol') to be used with the degree-list shortcode.

= 3.2.5 =
Bug Fixes:
- Updated the degree importer to ensure existing taxonomy term associations are removed from each degree before assigning new terms

Enhancements:
- Removed the careers column from the degree CPT admin view to reduce clutter.

= 3.2.4 =
Bug Fixes:
- Updated degree importer to account for hierarchical taxonomies, which can't be added by ID.
- Fixed array merge bug in `UCF_Degree_Config::get_api_select_options()` to preserve associative array key integrity.

= 3.2.3 =
Bug Fixes:
- Removed incorrect syntax in filter parameters.

= 3.2.2 =
Enhancements:
- Added ability to turn api calls to search service on and off for tuition

= 3.2.1. =
Bug Fixes:
- Updated `get_parent_program_id()` to return the program's parent ID from `$this->program->parent_program->id` instead of fetching per-parent API results.  See https://github.com/UCF/Search-Service-Django/pull/28.
- Increased API fetch timeout from 5 seconds to 10
- Added check in `UCF_Degree_Common::return_verified_result()` to ensure `$results` is an array before attempting to loop through it.  Resolves #83 .

= 3.2.0 =
Enhancements:
* Updated the degree importer to get the tuition data from the `program` object in the search service (recently added).
* Adds a filter for adjusting the tuition string.
* Adds the `degree_tuition_skip` field which, when checked, will add a `TuitionOverride` object to the search service via an API call.
* Adds admin messages for letting the user know if the API call is successful.

= 3.1.0 =
Enhancements:
* Added the "Areas of Interest" (`interests`) taxonomy for Degrees
* Added API endpoints for interests and post tags
* Added an importer for interests
* Added a hook for modifying grouped degree lists by taxonomy (`ucf_degree_group_posts_by_tax`)
* Added a hook for modifying the sort order of grouped degree lists outputted by the [degree-list] shortcode (`ucf_degree_list_sort_grouped_degrees`)

Bug Fixes:
* Added missing quote to class attribute on the `ucf-degree-list-title` heading.
* Fixed an incorrect function name in `function_exists()` call for `ucf_degree_group_posts_by_tax`.

= 3.0.2 =
Enhancements:
* Adds the `program_types` and `colleges` GET parameters to the `/wp/v2/degrees/` endpoint.
* Adds very simple college schema to each result in the `ucf-degree-search/v1/degrees/` endpoint.

= 3.0.1 =
Enhancements:
* Updated profile and description type fetches to cache failed responses for 2 minutes, to avoid subsequent external requests to the API on every admin page load
* Added default empty option to profile and description type dropdowns on the plugin options page for improved clarity when an option hasn't been selected

= 3.0.0 =
Enhancements:
* Refactored the degree import script for compatibility with the new UCF Search Service.  Note that the updated Search Service requires an API key for any access; you will not be able to import fresh degree data until obtaining an API key.
* The default set of Program Type terms has been updated.  Degrees are now explicitly assigned both a parent and child Program Type term, e.g. "Undergraduate Program" AND "Bachelor" (previously, only the child term was explicitly assigned).
* Degree subplans are now saved as separate degree posts.  Subplans are saved as direct children of their parent degree program (are hierarchical).
* Removed the following degree meta data: `degree_type_id`, `degree_description`
* Added the following degree meta data: `degree_api_id`, `degree_plan_code`, `degree_subplan_code`, `degree_name_short`
* Updated the Degree Search API REST controller to organize results with plan/subplan hierarchy, and to add support for the updated Program Type default terms + their expected sort order.
* Unique site-specific degree profile URLs and descriptions (degree `post_content` values) can now be written back up to the UCF Search Service whenever a degree is modified.

**Please note that this version of the plugin is not compatible with previous plugin versions' imported degree data.**  If you require use of the degree import script, we recommend deleting all existing Program Type and Department terms (if applicable) before running a fresh degree import to ensure that all stale degrees are removed and new degrees are imported successfully.

= 2.0.3 =
Enhancements:
* Adds an endpoint for retrieving degree-specific Relevanssi results.

= 2.0.2 =
Bug Fixes/Enhancements:
* Added improvements to how degrees are matched with undergraduate catalog URLs in the degree importer

= 2.0.1 =
Enhancements:
* Added fullname and plural to degree-search API colleges and program-types

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed notices

= 2.0.0 =
Enhancements:
* Converts layout actions for degree lists and career path lists to filters, and consolidates arguments passed to degree list layout functions.  Please note this change is not backward-compatible with layouts registered using hooks provided by older versions of the plugin.
* Changed the generic class name "Degrees" to "UCF_Degree_Commands"
* Removed anonymous function calls for improved support with older versions of PHP
* Fixed plugin activation and deactivation hooks being referenced outside of the if-statements that check whether or not the functions exist yet.

= 1.1.0 =
Bug Fixes:
* Fixed bug with output of `UCF_Degree_PostType::taxonomies()` still returning nonexistent taxonomies
* Fixed calls to `$wpdb->prepare` to suppress warnings

Enhancements:
* Adds logic to import degrees from the search service
* Adds a configuration option for filtering degrees from the search service (i.e. by college)
* Adds an option to schedule the import via wp-cron (the actual logic for adding the wp-cron task still needs to be written)
* Adds some hooks that should allow the import process to be extended for a specific site's needs.
* Added the helper method `UCF_Degree_Program_Types_Common::get_name_or_alias()`, which returns a program type's alias, if available, or name.

= 1.0.2 =
Bug Fixes:
* Fixed rewrite rule issues on plugin activation/deactivation.

Enhancements:
* Added a custom REST route for the Angular degree search.
* The degree-search api now orders the results by program_types using the new `order_by-taxonomy`, `order_by_taxonomy_field` and `order_by_taxonomy_order` fields.

= 1.0.1 =
Bug Fixes:
* Updated to detect if the now built-in REST API is available.

Enhancements:
* Added postmeta to the meta field of the api.
